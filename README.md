Emacs Dart IDE using [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) to connect to [Dart Analysis Server](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analysis_server).

<img width="16" alt="flutter_logo" align="top" src="images/flutter-logo.svg"> LSP works great with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), but there are also other packages that may help to improve your development, for more info see [Additional packages](#additional-packages).

## Quickstart

The following has a example to setup `lsp-dart`.

```elisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)

(setq package-selected-packages 
  '(dart-mode lsp-mode lsp-dart lsp-treemacs flycheck company
    ;; Optional packages
    lsp-ui company hover))

(when (cl-find-if-not #'package-installed-p package-selected-packages)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (mapc #'package-install package-selected-packages))

(add-hook 'dart-mode-hook 'lsp)

(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 100 1024 1024)
      read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024))
```

## Features

Besides the `lsp-mode` features, `lsp-dart` implements the [custom methods features from the `dart_analysis_server`](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/pkg/analysis_server/tool/lsp_spec/README.md#custom-methods).

### Closing labels

### Tree views

`lsp-dart` uses `lsp-treemacs` for rendering some tree views features.

**`lsp-dart-show-outline`** [:warning:*](#features-only-available-for-dart-sdk-version-280-currently-the-dev-branch-or-above)

**`lsp-dart-show-flutter-outline`** [:warning:*](#features-only-available-for-dart-sdk-version-280-currently-the-dev-branch-or-above)

### Run/Debug tests

`lsp-dart-run-all-tests` - Run all tests from project.

`lsp-dart-run-test-file` - Run all tests from current test buffer.

`lsp-dart-run-test-at-point` - Run single test at point.

`lsp-dart-debug-test-at-point` - Debug single test at point.

`lsp-dart-visit-last-test` - Go to last ran test.

`lsp-dart-run-last-test` - Run last ran test.

`lsp-dart-debug-last-test` - Debug last ran test.

Running a test interactively:

![test](images/run-test.gif)

### Test tree

`lsp-dart-test-show-tree` - Open the test tree containing the latest ran tests.

![test-tree](images/test-tree.gif)

For more options, check the [settings section](#supported-settings).

### Flutter colors

Display the flutter colors on left fringe.

![flutter-fringe-colors](images/flutter-fringe-colors.gif)

You can disable the feature setting `lsp-dart-flutter-fringe-colors` to `nil`.

### Flutter widget guides

Display widget guide lines from parent to child widgets on flutter. [:warning:*](#features-only-available-for-dart-sdk-version-280-currently-the-dev-branch-or-above)

![flutter-widget-guides](images/flutter-widget-guides.png)

You can disable the feature setting `lsp-dart-flutter-widget-guides` to `nil`.

### Run or Debug

To run your app you can use `lsp-dart-run` which will use `dap-mode` but for running without debug. to pass custom arguments it's possible to pass a prefix-argument with arguments separated by space.

For debugging, `lsp-dart` uses [`dap-mode`](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode#dart).
You only need to run `lsp-dart-dap-setup` one time to setup the debugger to your Emacs and `dap-debug` to start the debug.

![debug](images/debug.gif)

#### Flutter

`lsp-dart` support Flutter debugging too via `dap-debug` with an option to select the device to debug.

![flutter-debug](images/flutter-debug.gif)

After the debug session has started, you can run:

`lsp-dart-flutter-hot-restart` - Trigger Flutter hot restart on the debug sessions.

`lsp-dart-flutter-hot-reload` - Trigger Flutter hot reload on the debug sessions.

For hot-reload/restart on buffer save you can enable `lsp-dart-dap-flutter-hot-reload-on-save` or `lsp-dart-dap-flutter-hot-restart-on-save`.

#### Custom templates

You can register a custom template for debugging with `dap-register-debug-template`, check the following example:

```elisp
(use-package lsp-dart
  :ensure t
  :hook (dart-mode . lsp)
  :init
  (dap-register-debug-template "Flutter :: Custom debug"
                               (list :flutterPlatform "x86_64"
                                     :program "lib/main_debug.dart"
                                     :args '("--flavor" "customer_a"))))
```
`flutterPlatform`,`:program`, and `:args` are all optional.

A full list of supported parameters can be found in the source of
the function `lsp-dart-dap--populate-flutter-start-file-args` in
`lsp-dart-dap.el`. Several of these parameters can be configured by
setting one of the [Supported settings](#supported-settings) with
matching names.

#### DevTools

You can also open the [Dart DevTools](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-devtools) on the current debug session with `lsp-dart-open-devtools`.

### Commands

lsp-dart supports running Flutter and Dart commands as following:

`lsp-dart-pub-get` - Run `pub get` or `flutter pub get` on project root.

`lsp-dart-pub-upgrade` - Run `pub upgrade` or `flutter pub upgrade` on project root.

`lsp-dart-pub-outdated` - Run `pub outdated` or `flutter pub outdated` on project root.

###### :warning:* Features only available for Dart SDK version 2.8.0 or above.

## FAQ

:grey_question: Emacs can't find my package, it keeps searching up until the dart root package folder.

:small_blue_diamond: Configure projectile to find the package pubspec.yaml and set the folder as project root:
```elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'projectile
  (add-to-list 'projectile-project-root-files-bottom-up "pubspec.yaml")
  (add-to-list 'projectile-project-root-files-bottom-up "BUILD"))
```

:grey_question: `LSP :: No LSP server for dart-mode(check *lsp-log*).`

:small_blue_diamond: Try to set the `lsp-dart-sdk-dir` to the Dart SDK dir installation or if you are using Flutter, `<your-flutter-dir>/bin/cache/dart-sdk/`.

:grey_question: `dap-debug` couldn't run the app on advices or white screen.

:small_blue_diamond: Try to set `export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1` into your `.bash_profile` file.
