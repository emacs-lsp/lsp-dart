Closing labels # Tree views # lsp-dart uses lsp-treemacs for rendering some tree views features. lsp-dart-show-outline * lsp-dart-show-flutter-outline * Run/Debug tests # lsp-dart-run-all-tests - Run all tests from project. lsp-dart-run-test-file - Run all tests from current test buffer. lsp-dart-run-test-at-point - Run single test at point. lsp-dart-debug-test-at-point - Debug single test at point. lsp-dart-visit-last-test - Go to last ran test. lsp-dart-run-last-test - Run last ran test. lsp-dart-debug-last-test - Debug last ran test. Running a test interactively: Test tree # lsp-dart-test-show-tree - Open the test tree containing the latest ran tests. For more options, check the settings section . Flutter colors # Display the flutter colors on left fringe. You can disable the feature setting lsp-dart-flutter-fringe-colors to nil . Flutter widget guides # Display widget guide lines from parent to child widgets on flutter. * You can disable the feature setting lsp-dart-flutter-widget-guides to nil . Run or Debug # To run your app you can use lsp-dart-run which will use dap-mode but for running without debug. to pass custom arguments it's possible to pass a prefix-argument with arguments separated by space. For debugging, lsp-dart uses dap-mode . You only need to run lsp-dart-dap-setup one time to setup the debugger to your Emacs and dap-debug to start the debug. Flutter # lsp-dart support Flutter debugging too via dap-debug with an option to select the device to debug. After the debug session has started, you can run: lsp-dart-flutter-hot-restart - Trigger Flutter hot restart on the debug sessions. lsp-dart-flutter-hot-reload - Trigger Flutter hot reload on the debug sessions. For hot-reload/restart on buffer save you can enable lsp-dart-dap-flutter-hot-reload-on-save or lsp-dart-dap-flutter-hot-restart-on-save . Custom templates # You can register a custom template for debugging with dap-register-debug-template , check the following example: ( use-package lsp-dart :ensure t :hook ( dart-mode . lsp ) :init ( dap-register-debug-template \"Flutter :: Custom debug\" ( list :flutterPlatform \"x86_64\" :program \"lib/main_debug.dart\" :args ' ( \"--flavor\" \"customer_a\" )))) flutterPlatform , :program , and :args are all optional. A full list of supported parameters can be found in the source of the function lsp-dart-dap--populate-flutter-start-file-args in lsp-dart-dap.el . Several of these parameters can be configured by setting one of the Supported settings with matching names. DevTools # You can also open the Dart DevTools on the current debug session with lsp-dart-open-devtools . Commands # lsp-dart supports running Flutter and Dart commands as following: lsp-dart-pub-get - Run pub get or flutter pub get on project root. lsp-dart-pub-upgrade - Run pub upgrade or flutter pub upgrade on project root. lsp-dart-pub-outdated - Run pub outdated or flutter pub outdated on project root. * Features only available for Dart SDK version 2.8.0 or above. # Supported settings # Variable Description Default lsp-dart-sdk-dir The optional Dart SDK path.
